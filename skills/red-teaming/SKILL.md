# Red Teaming

## Overview

Red teaming is a structured adversarial approach to testing organizational security posture by simulating real-world attacks. This skill provides comprehensive methodology for both **traditional cybersecurity red teaming** (network, physical, social engineering) and **AI/LLM red teaming** (prompt injection, jailbreaking, safety testing).

**Core Philosophy:** Think like an attacker, operate covertly, test holistically, document thoroughly.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users need:

### Cybersecurity Red Teaming
- **Adversary emulation** using MITRE ATT&CK framework
- **Network penetration testing** beyond traditional pen tests
- **Purple team exercises** (red-blue collaboration)
- **Security posture validation** before major deployments
- **Compliance testing** for TIBER, DORA, ISO 27001
- **Physical security assessment** and social engineering
- **Incident response readiness** testing

### AI/LLM Red Teaming
- **LLM safety validation** before production deployment
- **Prompt injection vulnerability** assessment
- **Jailbreaking resistance** testing
- **Data leakage detection** (PII, training data)
- **Bias and toxicity evaluation**
- **Multi-turn attack simulation**
- **Compliance validation** for OWASP Top 10 LLM, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act

### Key Indicators to Use This Skill
- "Test our security like a real attacker"
- "MITRE ATT&CK" or "adversary emulation"
- "LLM red teaming" or "prompt injection testing"
- "Purple team exercise"
- "Security audit" (holistic vs. point-in-time)
- "Jailbreak our AI model"

## Red Teaming Fundamentals

### Red Team vs. Other Security Approaches

| Aspect | Red Teaming | Penetration Testing | Vulnerability Assessment |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Scope** | Holistic, goal-oriented | Technical, scope-limited | Automated scanning |
| **Approach** | Covert, realistic attack | Overt testing | Compliance-driven |
| **Duration** | Weeks-months | Days-weeks | Hours-days |
| **Objective** | Compromise organization | Find vulnerabilities | Identify weaknesses |
| **Detection** | Avoid detection | Detection acceptable | N/A |
| **Focus** | People + Process + Technology | Technology only | Technology only |

### Core Principles

1. **Realistic Threat Modeling**
   - Base scenarios on actual threat actors relevant to industry
   - Use Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) over specific tools
   - Emulate adversary behavior patterns, not just exploit signatures

2. **Adversarial Mindset**
   - Think like an attacker: creative, patient, opportunistic
   - Exploit human factors, not just technical vulnerabilities
   - Chain multiple small weaknesses into critical impact

3. **Stealth Operations**
   - Avoid detection by security tools and personnel
   - Use living-off-the-land techniques
   - Gradual escalation to avoid triggering alarms

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test all attack surfaces: physical, digital, human
   - Multi-vector approach (not single exploit chains)
   - Test detection AND response capabilities

5. **Evidence-Based Reporting**
   - Document every step with screenshots, logs, timestamps
   - Provide proof of exploitation, not just theoretical risks
   - Actionable remediation recommendations

6. **Ethical Boundaries**
   - Operate within rules of engagement
   - Obtain proper authorization
   - Avoid collateral damage to business operations

## Universal Red Teaming Methodology

All red team engagements follow this core process, adapted for cybersecurity or AI domains:

### Phase 1: Planning

**Objective:** Define scope, objectives, rules of engagement

**Key Activities:**
- **Scope Definition**
  - Target systems, networks, applications
  - In-scope vs. out-of-scope boundaries
  - Time constraints and testing windows
  
- **Objectives & Goals**
  - What are we trying to compromise? (data, access, control)
  - Success criteria (e.g., "exfiltrate customer database", "bypass AI safety filters")
  - Realistic vs. theoretical scenarios
  
- **Threat Modeling**
  - Identify relevant threat actors (APT groups, insider threats, etc.)
  - Map threat landscape to organizational risk profile
  - Select TTPs to emulate (MITRE ATT&CK for cyber, OWASP for AI)
  
- **Rules of Engagement**
  - Authorization documentation
  - Restricted actions (e.g., no DoS, no data destruction)
  - Escalation procedures
  - Communication protocols
  - Legal and compliance requirements
  
- **Team Assembly**
  - Red team members and specializations
  - Blue team awareness (known vs. unknown exercise)
  - White cell coordination (exercise management)

**Deliverable:** Red team operation plan with objectives, scope, rules, timeline

### Phase 2: Reconnaissance & Intelligence Gathering

**Objective:** Collect information about target without detection

**Key Activities:**
- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**
  - Public records, social media, company websites
  - Technology stack identification
  - Employee information and organizational structure
  - For AI: Model documentation, API specifications, training data sources
  
- **Technical Reconnaissance**
  - Network mapping and asset discovery
  - Subdomain enumeration and infrastructure fingerprinting
  - For AI: Endpoint testing, model architecture inference
  
- **Social Intelligence**
  - Employee behavior patterns
  - Communication channels and workflows
  - Physical security observations

**Deliverable:** Intelligence dossier with target information and attack surface map

### Phase 3: Attack Execution

**Objective:** Exploit identified weaknesses to achieve objectives

**Key Activities:**
- **Initial Access**
  - Exploit vulnerabilities in perimeter defenses
  - Phishing, social engineering, or physical intrusion
  - For AI: Prompt injection, API abuse
  
- **Establish Persistence**
  - Install backdoors and command & control (C2)
  - Create alternative access methods
  - For AI: Inject persistent instructions, poison context
  
- **Privilege Escalation**
  - Exploit local vulnerabilities
  - Credential theft and lateral movement
  - For AI: Escalate from user to system-level control
  
- **Goal Achievement**
  - Data exfiltration, system compromise, or other objectives
  - Maintain stealth throughout operation
  
- **Clean-up & Evidence Collection**
  - Document all actions with evidence
  - Remove traces if required (or leave for blue team training)

**Deliverable:** Exploitation evidence with step-by-step attack chain documentation

### Phase 4: Reporting & Debriefing

**Objective:** Communicate findings and provide actionable recommendations

**Key Activities:**
- **Comprehensive Report**
  - Executive summary (business impact, risk levels)
  - Technical findings (vulnerabilities exploited, attack paths)
  - Evidence (screenshots, logs, PoC code)
  - Remediation recommendations (prioritized by risk)
  
- **Presentation & Debriefing**
  - Present findings to stakeholders
  - Demonstrate attack techniques (if safe)
  - Answer questions and provide clarifications
  
- **Blue Team Collaboration**
  - Share indicators of compromise (IOCs)
  - Discuss detection gaps and improvements
  - Purple team knowledge transfer

**Deliverable:** Final red team report with findings, evidence, and remediation roadmap

## Best Practices

### Planning Phase
- **Understand Business Context**: Align testing with business priorities and risk tolerance
- **Set Clear Success Criteria**: Define measurable objectives before starting
- **Document Everything**: Authorization, scope, rules of engagement must be in writing

### Execution Phase
- **Start Low & Slow**: Gradual reconnaissance avoids detection
- **Diversify Attack Vectors**: Don't rely on single technique
- **Monitor Blue Team Response**: Evaluate detection and response capabilities
- **Maintain Operational Security**: Protect red team infrastructure and tactics

### Reporting Phase
- **Prioritize Findings**: Focus on business impact, not technical severity alone
- **Provide Context**: Explain realistic attack scenarios, not just theoretical risks
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Give specific, implementable remediation steps
- **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge effective defenses alongside vulnerabilities

### Organizational Culture
- **No Blame Culture**: Red teaming is learning, not punishment
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular exercises (quarterly or bi-annually)
- **Purple Team Collaboration**: Break down red-blue silos
- **Executive Buy-In**: Ensure leadership understands value and supports findings
