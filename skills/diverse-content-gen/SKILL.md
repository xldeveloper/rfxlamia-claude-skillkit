# Diverse Content Generation using Verbalized Sampling

## Overview

This skill teaches agents how to use **Verbalized Sampling (VS)** - a research-backed prompting technique that dramatically increases output diversity (1.6-2.1× improvement) without sacrificing quality.

**The Problem:** Standard aligned LLMs suffer from "mode collapse" - they generate overly similar, safe, predictable outputs because of typicality bias in training data.

**The Solution:** Instead of asking for single instances ("write a blog post"), VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over multiple responses ("generate 5 blog post ideas with their probabilities").

**Core Principle:** Different prompt types collapse to different modes. Distribution-level prompts recover the diverse base model distribution, while instance-level prompts collapse to the most typical output.

## Workflow Decision Tree

**Detect user intent, route to appropriate reference:**

| User Request Pattern | Route To | Description |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| "Generate diverse [content]" | `references/vs-core-technique.md` | Learn VS basics, prompt templates, execution |
| "Write 5 blog posts / captions / ideas" | `references/task-workflows.md` | Task-specific workflows pre-configured |
| "Need higher quality" or "too wild" | `references/advanced-techniques.md` | VS-CoT, VS-Multi, parameter tuning |
| "Save to file" or "batch process 50 items" | `references/tool-integration.md` | VS + File tools, batch workflows |
| "VS outputs too similar" or errors | `references/troubleshooting.md` | Common pitfalls and solutions |
| "Which model works best?" | `references/research-findings.md` | Benchmarks, model compatibility |

**Default workflow:** Load `vs-core-technique.md` first, then load additional references as needed.

## When to Use This Skill

### Trigger Scenarios

**Use VS when user requests:**
- "Give me **multiple variations/options/ideas**"
- "I need **diverse** [content type]"
- "**Brainstorm** several approaches to..."
- "Generate **different angles** for..."
- "Avoid repetitive/similar outputs"

**Use VS for these content types:**
- Creative writing (blog posts, stories, poems, scripts)
- Marketing (campaign ideas, taglines, ad copy, social captions)
- Product content (descriptions, feature bullets, value props)
- Ideation (brainstorming, exploration, strategy options)
- Open-ended QA (tasks with multiple valid answers)

**DON'T use VS for:**
- Single-answer factual questions
- Tasks requiring deterministic output
- When user explicitly wants "the best" single answer
- Real-time low-latency applications

## Quick Start (30-Second Version)

**For agents who need VS immediately:**

### 1. Detect Need
User wants multiple variations → Use VS

### 2. Basic VS Prompt Template
```
Generate {k} responses to: {user_request}

Return JSON format with key "responses" (list of dicts).
Each dict must include:
• text: the response string only
• probability: estimated probability (0.0-1.0)

Give ONLY the JSON object, no extra text.
```

### 3. Standard Parameters
- **k = 5** (candidates per call)
- **temperature = 0.8**
- **threshold = 0.10** (optional, for more diversity)

### 4. Process Output
```python
import json
data = json.loads(llm_output)
candidates = data["responses"]
# Present to user ranked by probability
```

**For detailed instructions:** Load `references/vs-core-technique.md`

## Progressive Learning Path

**Recommended loading sequence:**

### Level 1: Basics (Required)
1. Start here: `references/vs-core-technique.md`
   - VS theory and why it works
   - Copy-paste ready prompt templates
   - Step-by-step execution workflow
   - Output parsing and presentation

### Level 2: Task-Specific (Choose based on use case)
2. Load: `references/task-workflows.md`
   - Blog post ideas workflow
   - Social media captions workflow
   - Campaign/strategy ideas workflow
   - Story/narrative generation workflow

### Level 3: Advanced (On-demand)
3. When needed:
   - **Higher quality needed:** `references/advanced-techniques.md` (VS-CoT, VS-Multi)
   - **File operations:** `references/tool-integration.md` (Write, batch processing)
   - **Issues/errors:** `references/troubleshooting.md` (Pitfalls & fixes)
   - **Model selection:** `references/research-findings.md` (Benchmarks)

## Quick Reference Card

**Copy this for quick lookup:**

| Parameter | Default Value | When to Adjust |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| k (candidates) | 5 | Use 3 for quick, 10 for exploration |
| Temperature | 0.7-1.0 | Combine with VS for extra diversity |
| Probability threshold | 0.10 (optional) | Lower (0.01) for more creative outputs |

**Troubleshooting shortcuts:**
- Outputs too similar? → Lower threshold OR increase k OR load `advanced-techniques.md`
- Quality too low? → VS-Multi workflow (see `advanced-techniques.md`)
- JSON parsing errors? → Emphasize "ONLY JSON" OR use regex extraction
- Not sure which model? → Load `research-findings.md`

**Quality checklist before presenting:**
- [ ] Diversity achieved (different angles/styles)
- [ ] Quality maintained (baseline standards)
- [ ] User intent matched
- [ ] Clean formatting (no JSON artifacts)

## Resources

This skill uses progressive disclosure for optimal token efficiency:

### references/
Documentation loaded on-demand based on agent needs:

- **vs-core-technique.md** - Core VS concepts, prompt templates, execution steps
- **task-workflows.md** - Pre-configured workflows for common content types
- **advanced-techniques.md** - VS-CoT, VS-Multi, parameter tuning, refinement
- **tool-integration.md** - Combining VS with file tools, batch processing
- **troubleshooting.md** - Common pitfalls and solutions
- **research-findings.md** - Performance benchmarks, model compatibility data

**Pattern:** Agent loads SKILL.md first (routing), then loads specific references as needed during execution.

## Examples in Context

### Example 1: Simple Brainstorming
**User:** "Give me 5 tagline ideas for a coffee shop"

**Agent workflow:**
1. Detect: "5 ideas" → VS needed
2. Load: `vs-core-technique.md` (if not already loaded)
3. Execute: VS prompt with k=5
4. Parse & present: 5 diverse taglines

### Example 2: Production Content
**User:** "Write 10 blog post ideas about AI, I need them saved to a file"

**Agent workflow:**
1. Detect: "10 ideas" + "saved to file" → VS + file tools
2. Load: `vs-core-technique.md` + `tool-integration.md`
3. Execute: VS with k=5, make 2 calls
4. Process: Format as markdown
5. Write: Use Write tool to save file

### Example 3: Quality Refinement
**User:** "These are good but need more polish for production use"

**Agent workflow:**
1. Detect: Quality improvement needed
2. Load: `advanced-techniques.md`
3. Execute: VS-Multi workflow (initial VS → user selects → refine)
4. Deliver: Polished output
