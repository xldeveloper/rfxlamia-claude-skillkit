# Validate Plan

## Overview

Comprehensive validation workflow for development implementation plans. This skill systematically analyzes plans against DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles while performing codebase-aware gap analysis to prevent implementation disasters.

**Use when:**
- Reviewing implementation plans created by /writing-plans
- Validating development plans before execution
- Checking plans for DRY/YAGNI/TDD compliance
- Preventing over-engineering and scope creep
- Ensuring test-first approach in development workflow

**Triggers:** `/validate-plan` or "Validate this implementation plan"

---

## Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Plan Discovery

**Ask user:** "Which plan should I validate? (Provide file path or plan name)"

If user provides plan:
1. Load plan file
2. Extract metadata: feature name, tech stack, hypothesis
3. Identify all tasks and their structure

### Step 2: Codebase Analysis

**Scan existing codebase for:**
- Existing implementations of similar functionality
- Reusable components, utilities, patterns
- Project structure and conventions
- Test patterns and frameworks
- Previous implementations that could be referenced

**Key questions:**
- What functionality already exists that could be reused?
- What patterns are established in the codebase?
- Where should new files be placed?
- What testing approach is already used?

### Step 3: DRY Validation

**Checklist for Don't Repeat Yourself:**

| Check | Description | Finding Level |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Functionality Check** | Does the plan propose implementing functionality that already exists? | CRITICAL |
| **Code Reuse** | Are there existing utilities/components that could be reused? | CRITICAL |
| **Abstraction** | Does the plan duplicate similar patterns without abstraction? | WARNING |
| **Library Choice** | Is the plan using the same libraries already in the project? | INFO |

**Common DRY violations to detect:**
- Creating new validation logic when validation utilities exist
- Reimplementing API clients when shared clients exist
- Duplicating UI components instead of extending existing ones
- Writing new auth logic when auth system exists

### Step 4: YAGNI Validation

**Checklist for You Aren't Gonna Need It:**

| Check | Description | Finding Level |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Over-abstraction** | Does the plan create abstractions without concrete use cases? | WARNING |
| **Future-proofing** | Are there features planned for hypothetical future needs? | WARNING |
| **Complexity** | Is the solution more complex than the problem requires? | CRITICAL |
| **Scope Creep** | Are there tasks outside the core requirement? | WARNING |

**Common YAGNI violations to detect:**
- Creating plugin architectures when no plugins are planned
- Adding configuration options that won't be changed
- Building admin interfaces before user features are proven
- Optimizing for scale before product-market fit

### Step 5: TDD Validation

**Checklist for Test-Driven Development:**

| Check | Description | Finding Level |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Test-First** | Are tests written BEFORE implementation? | CRITICAL |
| **Red-Green** | Does each task follow red-green-refactor cycle? | CRITICAL |
| **Test Commands** | Are exact test commands specified with expected output? | WARNING |
| **Coverage** | Is there a clear testing strategy for each component? | WARNING |
| **Commits** | Are commits tied to test milestones? | INFO |

**TDD Anti-patterns to detect:**
- "Write tests" as a separate task at the end
- Implementation without corresponding test steps
- Vague test instructions without expected outcomes
- Missing edge case testing

### Step 6: Gap Analysis

**Technical Specification Gaps:**
- Missing exact file paths
- Unclear acceptance criteria
- Vague implementation details
- Missing error handling specifications
- No rollback/contingency plans

**Architecture Gaps:**
- Wrong file locations (violating project structure)
- Missing integration patterns
- No database schema changes specified
- Missing API contract details

**Disaster Prevention:**
- Breaking changes not identified
- Missing security considerations
- No performance requirements
- Missing dependency analysis

### Step 7: Generate Validation Report

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Plan Validation Report: [Feature Name]

## Executive Summary
- **Critical Issues:** [N] blockers must be fixed
- **Warnings:** [N] improvements recommended
- **Info:** [N] suggestions for enhancement
- **Overall Grade:** [A-F]

```

### Step 8: Interactive Improvement

**Present findings to user:**

```
🎯 **PLAN VALIDATION COMPLETE**

1. [Warning with explanation]

## ✨ INFO (Nice to Have)
1. [Suggestion]

**IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS:**
- **all** - Apply all suggested improvements
- **critical** - Apply only critical issues
- **select** - Choose specific items
- **none** - Keep plan as-is
- **details** - Show more details
```

**After user selection:**
- Apply accepted changes to plan
- Ensure changes look natural (not "added" or "enhanced")
- Maintain original plan structure

## Validation Principles

### DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

**Principle:** Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation.

**Validation Approach:**
- Search codebase for similar functionality
- Identify reuse opportunities
- Flag duplicate logic patterns
- Check for existing abstractions

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Is this functionality already implemented elsewhere?
2. Can this use existing utilities/components?
3. Should this be a shared abstraction?
4. Is this the right place for this logic?

### YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It

**Principle:** Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed.

**Validation Approach:**
- Check for speculative features
- Identify over-engineering
- Flag premature optimization
- Detect scope creep

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Is this feature required for the current scope?
2. Is this abstraction solving a real problem?
3. Will this configuration ever be changed?
4. Is this optimization necessary now?

### TDD - Test-Driven Development

**Principle:** Write tests before implementation; red-green-refactor cycle.

**Validation Approach:**
- Verify test-first approach
- Check for red-green-refactor steps
- Validate test coverage
- Ensure commit granularity

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Is the test written before the implementation?
2. Does the plan specify expected test failures?
3. Are test commands exact with expected output?
4. Are commits at test milestones?

## Example Usage

### Input: Plan to Validate

```markdown
# User Authentication Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Add user login functionality

### Task 1: Create Login Component

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`

**Step 1: Write test**
```typescript
// Test login form renders
describe('LoginForm', () => {
  it('renders email and password inputs', () => {
    render(<LoginForm />);
    expect(screen.getByLabelText('Email')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByLabelText('Password')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify failure**
```bash
npm test LoginForm.test.tsx
```
Expected: FAIL - component not found

**Step 3: Implement minimal component**
```tsx
export function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input name="email" />
      <input name="password" type="password" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify pass**
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add LoginForm component with tests"
```
```

### Output: Validation Report

```markdown
# Plan Validation Report: User Authentication

## Executive Summary
- **Critical Issues:** 0
- **Warnings:** 1
- **Info:** 1
- **Overall Grade:** A

## DRY Analysis
- No duplicate functionality detected
- Consider using existing `Input` component from `src/components/ui/`

## YAGNI Analysis
- Clean implementation, no over-engineering detected

## TDD Analysis
- Follows red-green-refactor cycle
- Test commands are specific
- Minor: Add edge case test for invalid email format

## Codebase Context
- Existing `src/components/ui/Input.tsx` can be reused
- Auth utilities exist in `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Form validation pattern in `src/hooks/useForm.ts`

## Recommendations
1. **INFO:** Reuse `Input` component for consistency
2. **WARNING:** Add error handling test case
```

## Common Anti-Patterns to Detect

### Plan Structure Issues

1. **Missing acceptance criteria**
   - ❌ "Implement the feature"
   - ✅ "Feature accepts X input and returns Y output"

2. **Vague test instructions**
   - ❌ "Write tests"
   - ✅ "Write test: when input is invalid, show error message"

3. **Missing file paths**
   - ❌ "Create component"
   - ✅ "Create: `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`"

4. **Implementation without tests**
   - ❌ Write code → Test later
   - ✅ Write failing test → Make it pass → Refactor

### DRY Violations

1. **Reinventing utilities**
   - ❌ Create new `formatDate()` when `date-fns` is available
   - ✅ Use existing library

2. **Duplicate API logic**
   - ❌ New fetch wrapper per component
   - ✅ Use shared API client

### YAGNI Violations

1. **Premature abstraction**
   - ❌ "Create plugin system for future extensions"
   - ✅ Implement direct solution first

2. **Over-configuration**
   - ❌ "Add 10 config options"
   - ✅ Hardcode defaults, expose when needed

### TDD Violations

1. **Testing after implementation**
   - ❌ Task 1: Implement → Task 5: Add tests
   - ✅ Each task: Test → Implement → Commit

2. **Missing red phase**
   - ❌ "Write test and run it"
   - ✅ "Run test, verify it FAILS with expected error"

## Integration with Workflows

### With /writing-plans

After writing-plans creates a plan:
1. User runs `/validate-plan`
2. Load the generated plan
3. Perform comprehensive validation
4. Apply improvements if needed
5. Proceed to /executing-plans

### With /executing-plans

Validated plans have:
- Clear, testable steps
- Exact file paths
- Verified DRY/YAGNI/TDD compliance
- Lower risk of implementation issues
