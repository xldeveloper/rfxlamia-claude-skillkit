## Section 2: Research Workflow

### Step 2.1: Search Strategy

**Search Pattern for 48-hour news:**
```
Query 1: "[topic] news today"
Query 2: "[topic] latest developments 2025"  
Query 3: "[topic] emerging trend"
Query 4: "[topic] [specific subtopic] news"
```

**Source Quality Criteria:**
- Prioritize: Original sources, industry publications, verified news
- Avoid: Aggregators, outdated content, unverified claims
- Check: Publication date within 48 hours when possible

### Step 2.2: Signal Extraction

**Extract from each source:**
1. **Primary Signal**: What's the core news/change?
2. **Stakeholders**: Who is affected or driving this?
3. **Timeline**: When did this emerge? How fast is it moving?
4. **Cultural Context**: What broader shift does this represent?

## Section 3: Elicitation Analysis

### Method Selection Framework

**Load:** `knowledge/elicitation-methods.md`

**Context Analysis:**

├── Stakeholder Diversity (single → multiple groups)
├── Risk Profile (low → high impact)
├── Creative Potential (incremental → disruptive)
└── Time Sensitivity (slow burn → urgent)
```

**Recommended Method Categories by Context:**

| Context Type | Primary Methods | Secondary Methods |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Tech disruption | Tree of Thoughts, Pre-mortem | First Principles, What If |
| Consumer behavior | User Persona Focus Group, Stakeholder Round Table | 5 Whys, Comparative Matrix |
| Cultural shift | Time Traveler Council, Genre Mashup | Socratic Questioning, Hindsight |
| Business/market | Shark Tank Pitch, SCAMPER | Red Team vs Blue Team, Failure Mode |
| Controversy/risk | Debate Club Showdown, Devil's Advocate | Self-Consistency, Expert Panel |
