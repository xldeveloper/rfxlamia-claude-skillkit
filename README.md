## What is SkillKit?

SkillKit is a toolkit for **creating and validating custom AI agent skills**. It ships two core skills:

- **`skillkit`** — meta-skill for creating new skills and subagents with dual-mode validation
- **`skillkit-help`** — pre-build orientation: understand what skills are, decide skills vs subagents

> Looking for community skills & agents? Use: **`npx @rfxlamia/sm`** → [SkillKit Marketplace](https://github.com/skillkit-marketplace/skills)

## Install

| `create skill` | Full skill creation | 12 steps with research + validation |
| `create subagent` | Subagent creation | 8 steps with template-based workflow |
| `validate skill` | Validation only | Structure, references, quality checks |
| `Skills vs Subagents` | Decision helper | Recommends approach, then creates |
| `convert doc to skill` | Migration | Transform existing docs into skills |
