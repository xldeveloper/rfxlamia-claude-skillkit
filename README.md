# SkillKit

**Build custom skills for your AI workflow agent — and share them with thousands.**

SkillKit is an open toolkit for creating reusable skills that extend how your AI agent works. Works across Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and other AI coding tools. Install community-built skills in seconds, or create your own in ~10 minutes and contribute them back.

## What is SkillKit?

SkillKit is a plugin for AI agents that provides a collection of **25 skills** and **7 subagents** designed to extend Claude's capabilities across content creation, engineering frameworks, security testing, and more.

At its core, SkillKit includes a **meta-skill** (`skillkit`) that helps create and validate new skills/subagents using a dual-mode workflow:
- **Fast mode** for quick structural validation
- **Full mode** for structural + behavioral validation with TDD-style pressure testing

> Not sure what skills are or if you need one? Run `/skillkit-help` first.
> Ready to build? Run `/skillkit`.

<summary>Other install methods</summary>
**Manual (Clone + Copy)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rfxlamia/skillkit.git
cp -r skillkit/skills/. ~/.claude/skills/
cp skillkit/agents/. ~/.claude/agents/
```

**Plugin Marketplace (Currently Broken)**

> **⚠️ Known issue:** Installation via the Claude Code plugin marketplace is currently broken. The `disable-model-invocation` error prevents skills from being invoked after install. Use `npx` instead.

## Core: SkillKit Creator

The `skillkit` skill is the engine that powers creation of new skills and subagents.

| Trigger | Workflow | Steps |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `create skill` | Full skill creation | 12 steps with research + validation |
| `create subagent` | Subagent creation | 8 steps with template-based workflow |
| `validate skill` | Validation only | Structure, references, quality checks |
| `Skills vs Subagents` | Decision helper | Recommends approach, then creates |
| `convert doc to skill` | Migration | Transform existing docs into skills |

Quality target: **9.0+/10** via 5-layer validation and multi-proposal generation.
