## What is SkillKit?

SkillKit v2 is a plugin for AI agents that provides a collection of **24 skills** and **7 subagents** designed to extend Claude's capabilities across content creation, engineering frameworks, security testing, and more.

At its core, SkillKit v2 includes a **meta-skill** (`skillkit`) that helps create and validate new skills/subagents using a dual-mode workflow:
- **Fast mode** for quick structural validation
- **Full mode** for structural + behavioral validation with TDD-style pressure testing

In short, SkillKit v2 is a practical system for building reliable Claude capabilities with repeatable quality gates, not just a template pack.

## Core: SkillKit Creator

The `skillkit` skill is the engine that powers creation of new skills and subagents.

### Workflows

| Trigger | Workflow | Steps |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `create skill` | Full skill creation | 12 steps with research + validation |
| `create subagent` | Subagent creation | 8 steps with template-based workflow |
| `validate skill` | Validation only | Structure, references, quality checks |
| `Skills vs Subagents` | Decision helper | Recommends approach, then creates |
| `convert doc to skill` | Migration | Transform existing docs into skills |

### Quality Targets

- Quality score: **9.0+/10**
- 5-layer validation with automated checks
- Research phase with 3-5 web searches before building
- Multi-proposal generation (3-5 design options)

---

## Installation

### As a Claude Code Plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add rfxlamia/skillkit
```

### Manual Installation

Clone the repository into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rfxlamia/skillkit.git
```

Then reference the skills/agents in your Claude Code configuration.

---

## Quick Start

### Create a New Skill

```
/skillkit create skill "my-awesome-skill"
```

### Create a New Subagent

```
/skillkit create subagent "my-subagent"
```

### Validate an Existing Skill

```bash
python3 skills/skillkit/scripts/validate_skill.py path/to/skill/ --format json
```

### Decide: Skill vs Subagent?

```bash
python3 skills/skillkit/scripts/decision_helper.py "code review assistant"
```

## Automation Scripts

14 Python scripts in `skills/skillkit/scripts/` for skill lifecycle management:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `init_skill.py` | Initialize new skill directory structure |
| `init_subagent.py` | Initialize new subagent with YAML template |
| `validate_skill.py` | Structure and YAML validation |
| `token_estimator.py` | Token consumption and cost estimation |
| `split_skill.py` | Progressive disclosure auto-splitting |
| `pattern_detector.py` | Workflow pattern recommendation |
| `pattern_detector_new.py` | Enhanced pattern detection |
| `decision_helper.py` | Skills vs Subagents decision tree |
| `security_scanner.py` | Security vulnerability detection |
| `test_generator.py` | Automated test generation |
