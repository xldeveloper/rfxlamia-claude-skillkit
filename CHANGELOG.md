## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Unified `init.py` script with subcommand pattern (`skill` and `subagent` subcommands)
- Enhanced `validate_skill.py` with `--security-only`, `--tokens-only`, `--structure-only` flags
- Comprehensive test suite: `test_consolidation.py` with 17 tests

### Changed
- Consolidated 6 scripts into 2: `init_skill.py` + `init_subagent.py` → `init.py`, `security_scanner.py` + `token_estimator.py` → `validate_skill.py`
- Deprecated old scripts with clear migration warnings
- Updated all documentation references to use new commands
- ~800 lines of code saved through consolidation

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- `section-2-fast-creation-workflow.md` and `section-2-full-creation-workflow.md`: add `decision_answer.json` format documentation to STEP 0 so agents know the required JSON structure when using Mode 1 of `decision_helper.py`

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- `package_skill.py`: default output now saves `.skill` file inside the skill's own folder instead of CWD or parent directory
- `package_skill.py`: added `*.skill` exclusion filter to prevent self-inclusion on subsequent packaging runs
- `package_skill.py`: success message now shows absolute path and claude.ai usage hint
- `package_skill.py`: removed dead `is_project_directory()` function (was no longer reachable)

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- `section-2-fast-creation-workflow.md`: dedicated reference file for fast mode creation workflow (12 steps, 4 phases), making fast and full modes equally documented

### Changed
- `skillkit` SKILL.md: rewritten for symmetry — both Workflow A (fast) and Workflow B (full) now use identical summary+pointer format pointing to their respective reference files
- `skillkit` SKILL.md: frontmatter description updated with explicit WHAT/WHEN/triggers for better routing
- `skillkit` SKILL.md: reduced from 511 to 426 lines (bloat reduction, removed inline Python code block, condensed Section 8)
- `section-4-decision-workflow-skills-vs-subagents.md`: bash invocation block moved here from SKILL.md inline
- Quality score improved from 5.5/10 to 7.0/10

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-15
